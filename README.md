# Person Identification on INRIA dataset using HOG Feature descriptor.
## Different classifiers are trained for a comparison.
## Classifiers are SVM, Random Forest and XGBoost
Confusion matrices are used for every classifier for quantitative analysis

Resized images are used for computation of HOG. The images were resized to 134,70 dimensions before being used.
The dataset available in the repository is non-resized dataset
